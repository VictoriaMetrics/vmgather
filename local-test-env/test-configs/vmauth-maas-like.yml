# VMAuth config that mimics VictoriaMetrics Managed behavior
# Customer has: https://vm.example.com/1011/rw/prometheus
# Where /rw/prometheus works for /query but NOT for /export

  # User with read access - /rw/prometheus path
  # This simulates customer's setup where /rw works for query but not export
  - username: "monitoring-read"

    # For /query requests, route to /select/0/prometheus
    url_prefix: "http://vmselect:8481/select/0/prometheus"
    
  # User with write access - /rw/prometheus path
